Stuff To Do?

* If Nutshell bubble's pretty small, don't recap sentence. Just use "..."
* Fine-tuned choosing of text to snippet:
    * Choose # of paragraphs before & after a snippet
    * Choose paragraph based on snippet of text. (use Chrome text fragment API?)
    * If no #Header specified at all, grab first chunk of paragraphs
* Test on mobile
* Out-of-the-box integration with Wordpress, Tumblr, the main bloggin' sites?
* Customizeable...
    * Style for buttons (e.g. underline instead of "bubble")
    * Language
    * Alternative to :colon syntax - allow data-attr?
* Plugin API for different kinds of links, such as
    * Wikipedia articles: show image & intro paragraph
    * YouTube: auto-embed video & show description
    * Images
* LaTeX
* Embed option in a Nutshell bubble
* Embed/Link options for headers
* Subtle animation bugs
* Actually bother versioning Nutshell.js via jsdelivr's CDN
