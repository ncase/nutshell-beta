        <p>
            Hi! You're invited to try out the Nutshell beta!
            Feel free to try it out on your websites/blogs,
            and send me your feedback via however I contacted you.
            I'll credit you as a beta-tester when Nutshell "officially" launches. :)

        <h2>What can I do with Nutshell?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You can embed "expandable explanations" from
                other pages, websites, and authors,
                even if they were already written long ago!
            </li>
            <li>
                Your Nutshells can also have
                audio, video, and interactive shtuff.
                (But don't worry, Nutshell stays safe by sanitizing HTML and sandboxing iframes)

        </ul>

        <h2>How can I use Nutshell in my site?</h2>

        <p>
            First, if you'd like, try it out online with <a href="try?v=2">this interactive demo!</a>
            (This demo uses Markdown, but you can use Nutshell with any word-editor you like,
            or directly in HTML)
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="pics/editor.gif" width="600" style="border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        </p>
        <p>
            (<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If you're working in HTML, you can't just type "# Header"!
            Markdown parsing is NOT built into Nutshell, it's just part of the above demo!
            You have to actually put it in header tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Header&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.
            Likewise, a link has to be <code>&lt;a href='#Header'&gt;:link&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
            If you're working in a normal WYSIWYG text editor,
            make headers and :links (with colons) as usual.)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you liked that, here's how to install Nutshell in your blog or website...
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1:</b> Put this in a page somewhere, preferably the &lt;head&gt;:
        </p>
<input style="border:none; font-family:monospace; background:#333; color:#fff; border-radius: 2px; padding:2px 5px; font-size: 14.5px; width:100%"
    value='&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ncase/nutshell-beta@0.0.3/nutshell.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'
    onclick="this.select();"/>
        <p>
            <b>Step 2:</b> That's it.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Details on how to write & embed Nutshells are in <a href="try?v=2">the interactive demo</a>.
            Also, when embedding from other pages/sites,
            make sure <i>both</i> pages have Nutshell installed!
            If you're writing directly in HTML, you can see how this page does it itself
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ncase/nutshell-beta/blob/main/index.html#L26">on Github</a>.)

            <h2>Nutshell</h2>

                <p>
                    Nutshell lets you put "expandable explanations" in your writing, like this!
                    You can even make these explanations <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why do this? Well, if you were to explain something to me <i>in-person</i>,
                    I can ask "wait, what's that word mean", "could you break down that idea",
                    "tell me more!", etc.
                    But by default, writing is one-size-fits-all.
                    Nutshell doesn't solve that <i>completely</i>, but it lets your reader
                    tailor your writing &mdash; a lil' bit &mdash; to <i>their</i> prior knowledge, interests, and curiosity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (Why not just use links?
                    Because those break the flow of reading,
                    and your reader usually doesn't need
                    <i>everything</i> in that link, just a section.
                    Nutshell lets you embed "just a section",
                    and if you <a href="#flow">:click this Nutshell</a>,
                    you can see how it also preserves flow of reading!)
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b><a href="#Nutshell 2">:ðŸŽ‰ BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE ðŸŽ‰</a></b>
                </p>

            <h2>Flow</h2>

                <p>
                    As you can see, Nutshell stays <i>in</i> the writing,
                    keeping the reading flow from top-to-bottom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even better, when a Nutshell interrupts a sentence like this,
                    the sentence will be "recapped" afterwards,
                    so you can get back on the main train of thought!
                </p>

            <h2>Nutshell 2</h2>

                <p>
                    You don't have to write all these Nutshells from scratch!
                    You can embed Nutshells from other pages, other websites, other authors â€“
                    <i>even if they were already written long ago!</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    (Example: a snippet
                    <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/explorable-explanations/#Procedural-Rhetoric">:from a pretentious 2014 blog post</a>)
                </p>

                <p>
                    This means you can easily build upon your old ideas & explanations,
                    without having to repeat yourself or break the flow of reading with links.
                    But more importantly, this means you can build upon <i>others'</i> ideas & explanations,
                    and others can build upon yours.
                </p>

            <h2>What is Nutshell</h2>

            <p>
                Nutshell lets you put "expandable explanations" in your writing, like this!
                You can even make these explanations <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nutshells can be re-used across pages, websites, and authors.
                You don't need even to write new content â€“
                articles from the past can <em>already</em> be embedded as Nutshells!
                (For example, here's
                <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/back-to-the-future-with-rss/#HowdoesRSSwork">:a section from an old blog post.</a>)

            <h2>Why Nutshell</h2>

            <p>Why put "expandable explanations" in your writing?</p>

            <ol>
            <li>
                So your reader can get the background information they need â€“
                just-in-time, not just-in-case â€“
                all without:
                a) you re-explaining the basics for every article, or
                b) your reader breaking the flow of reading by clicking a link to <em>yet another</em> article.
            </li>
            <li>So your reader can tailor your article to <em>their</em> interests, and choose what they want to learn in-depth.</li>
            <li>So you can build upon your old ideas & explanations â€“ again, without re-explaining or breaking the flow of reading.</li>
            <li>So you can build upon <em>others'</em> great explanations, and vice versa! Imagine Wikipedia, if Wikipedia was <a href="#decentralization">:decentralized, not merely 'democratized'</a> and <a href="#WikipediasProblem">:actually good at explaining things to beginners</a>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Who did this</h2>

            <p>Nutshell was made by <a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a>, with the generous support of my Patreon backers!</p>

            <p>[Insert supporter names, once this isn't a Work-In-Progress anymore!]</p>

            <p>
                Special Thanks to <a href="https://spacie.me/">Spacie</a>,
                who I commissioned to code the first version of Nutshell,
                before its entire design got rebooted. Sorry Spacie.

            <h2>Decentralization</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Centralized</b> networks have a single person/organization at the center.
                They come in two flavors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Command & Control â€“ Orders go from top to bottom.
                    Think military, schools, or most companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Democratic â€“ The "bottom" gets to have a say about who's in top, or what the top does.
                    Think democracies, or websites with "user-generated content" (social media, YouTube, Wikipedia).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Decentralized</b> networks, on the other hand, <i>have</i> no center.
                Unlike even democracies, there <i>is no</i> top or bottom.
                Think old-fashioned local markets, natural human languages, or "peer-to-peer" technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Centralized & decentralized systems have different pros & cons.
                Centralized systems can be more efficient, but prone to abuse of power,
                because power is concentrated in a "single point of failure".
                Decentralized systems can be more innovative and resistant to abuse,
                but can be an inefficient mess.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Note: none of these are well-established technical definitions. I just made them up.)
            </p>

            <h2>Wikipedia's Problem</h2>

            <p><img src="pics/xkcd.png" alt=""></p>

            <p><i>(from <a href="https://xkcd.com/2501">xkcd</a>)</i></p>

            <p>
                I love Wikipedia, and I'm a monthly donor...
                but, well, it's usually edited by experts <em>for</em> experts.
                So if you're a beginner, you get treated to "introductions" like this:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Abstract algebra is a part of math which studies algebraic structures. These include: groups, rings, fields, matrices, vector spaces, algebras [...]  </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And that was from the <em>Simple English Wikipedia</em>.</p>

            <p>
                My hope is that since Nutshell is decentralized,
                meaning no edit wars over a single page, meaning for-beginner explanations won't
                get edited over by for-expert explanations...
                that'll let great explanations survive & thrive.
            </p>
