<h1>Interactive</h1>

<p>
Here's a Nutshell with a nice lil' interactive inside of it!
<b>Click & drag the shape-people:</b>

But wait! Ain't allowing scripts a security problem?
Indeed! In fact, if you see <a href="">where this Nutshell comes from</a>,
you'll find it's a MALICIOUS PAGE.
It tries to vandalize your website, and run its evil scripts.
</p>

<script>
alert("HA HA NOW I HAVE ALL YOUR CASH");
</script>

<style>
body{
    background:#ff4040;
    color:#fff;
    font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
}
</style>

<p>
Thankfully, it's foiled. Nutshell sanitizes out the bad scripts,
while allowing fun interactives to run in a safe sandbox!
